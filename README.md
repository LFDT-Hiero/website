# Hiero Website

This repo contains the website of Hiero (https://hiero.org).

## Building the website

The project is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and you need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) to build the website along with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

To help ensure that tailwindcss and Hugo play nicely together, the tailwindcss integration was stitched together based on the following articles:
[Making Tailwind JIT work with Hugo](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2021/11/making-tailwind-jit-work-hugo/)
[Making Tailwind JIT work with Hugo, the Version 3 edition](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/03/making-tailwind-jit-work-hugo-version-3-edition/)
